# herdr host

How reviewr runs inside herdr: the sidebar pane, the actions that manage it, sending comments to the agent, and turn tracking.

## Overview

reviewr ships as a herdr plugin. The manifest (`herdr-plugin.toml`) declares:

| entry   | name                      | does                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| pane    | `sidebar`                 | runs the reviewr binary                                  |
| actions | `toggle`, `open`, `close` | manage the sidebar pane                                  |
| event   | `worktree.created`        | auto-opens the sidebar (off with `auto_open = false`)    |

herdr owns the pane. The binary runs inside it. The actions and event follow the same placement contract.

The pane never shows herdr's blank grid. The binary paints its empty frame before the first git scan. A failing scan shows the error in the status line. A genuinely hung `git` leaves a frozen-but-visible sidebar. Neither is a blank pane.

## Sidebar actions

Users bind actions to keys with `[[keys.command]] type = "plugin_action"`. Scripts invoke them directly:

```
herdr plugin action invoke open --plugin persiyanov.reviewr
```

What each action does:

| action   | sidebar absent | sidebar present |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| `open`   | opens one      | does nothing    |
| `close`  | does nothing   | closes them all |
| `toggle` | opens one      | closes them all |

With valid plugin config, the shared rules are:

| question                 | answer                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| run it twice?            | it converges and exits 0, nothing stacks and nothing errors                   |
| does `auto_open` gate?   | no, event-only rules never apply, any placement opens (→ HH-PLACEMENT-CONFIGURED) |
| focus?                   | same rules as the toggle                                                      |
| on refusal, on success?  | exit 1 with one stderr line, exit 0 with one stdout line naming the pane      |
| what counts as open?     | any pane labeled `reviewr` in the workspace, in any tab                       |
| which workspace?         | the focused one, wherever the action is invoked from                          |
| what does `close` sweep? | every labeled pane, even one herdr's plugin registry forgot after a restart   |

Every action validates plugin config before inspecting the workspace (config.md). An action also refuses when there is no workspace context or an open is outside a git repo. Both outcomes land in `herdr plugin log list` with the same exit and line discipline.

## Sidebar placement

The placement settings come from `$HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR/config.toml`. Each action and event reads one config snapshot.

```toml
toggle_placement = "overlay"   # split | overlay | zoomed | tab   (default: split)
toggle_direction = "down"      # right | down, split only         (default: right)
auto_open = false              # auto-open on worktree.created    (default: true)
```

The cross-action invariants, coded for citation:

| code                      | Always true                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HH-PLACEMENT-CONFIGURED` | Every open uses the placement named by `toggle_placement`.  |
| `HH-ONE-SIDEBAR`          | At most one sidebar exists per workspace, in steady state.  |
| `HH-TAB-NAMED`            | A `tab` open names its fresh tab `reviewr`.                 |

A manual open keeps focus on the agent for `split`, and gives focus to reviewr otherwise. The event auto-opens `split` and `tab` only, never takes focus, and does nothing at all with `auto_open = false`.

A missing key uses its default. Invalid plugin config follows `config.md`. `toggle_direction` affects `split` only.

Each placement maps to one pane-open shape (`../docs/herdr-api-notes.md`):

| placement | selector        | direction         | covers the pane |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| `split`   | `--target-pane` | `right` or `down` | no              |
| `tab`     | `--workspace`   | none              | no              |
| `overlay` | active pane     | none              | yes             |
| `zoomed`  | `--target-pane` | none              | yes             |

A `split` or `zoomed` open attaches to the focused pane. When the context has none, it attaches to the workspace's first pane.

A `tab` open renames the tab herdr just created from its bare numeric label to `reviewr`, using the `tab_id` the pane-open result reports (→ HH-TAB-NAMED). The rename is cosmetic: when it fails — or an older herdr omits `tab_id` — the open still succeeds and the tab keeps its numeric label.

**Placement changed between open and close**

1. `toggle_placement = split`. The user toggles. A right split opens.
2. The user sets `toggle_placement = overlay`.
3. The user toggles. The script finds the labeled pane and closes it (→ HH-ONE-SIDEBAR).
4. The user toggles. An overlay opens (→ HH-PLACEMENT-CONFIGURED).

**Event with a covering placement**

1. `toggle_placement = zoomed`. A worktree is created.
2. The event fires. Zoomed is not an auto-open placement. Nothing opens.
3. The user toggles later. A zoomed pane opens and takes focus.

**HH-EVENT-BESIDE-LAYOUT — event beside a layout plugin**

1. `auto_open = false`. A layout plugin also handles `worktree.created`.
2. A worktree is created. herdr runs both handlers in any order.
3. reviewr opens nothing either way. The layout builds undisturbed.
4. The user toggles later. reviewr opens over the finished layout (→ HH-PLACEMENT-CONFIGURED).

**A layout plugin opens reviewr explicitly**

1. `auto_open = false`. The layout builds its tabs on the event (→ HH-EVENT-BESIDE-LAYOUT).
2. The layout invokes `open` while the new workspace has focus.
3. No labeled pane exists. The configured placement opens.
4. The layout re-runs `open`. The labeled pane exists. Nothing happens.
5. The user presses the toggle key. The sidebar closes (→ HH-ONE-SIDEBAR).

## Repo discovery

The binary reviews the pane's working directory, normalized to its git top level. A directory outside any repo shows an empty state.

## Sending to the agent

`Send` hands over every written comment at once, to a single agent. reviewr never guesses which agent that is.

| herdr reports          | `Send` does                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| one agent              | writes every comment into its input without submitting, then focuses it  |
| several agents         | opens the agent picker                                                   |
| no agent, or no answer | refuses and names the clipboard copy                                     |

A candidate is any pane in the sidebar's workspace carrying an `agent` field, except the sidebar's own. Placement does not narrow it, and no scope inside the workspace wins over another. The send asks rather than resolves.

A send that does not land says so in one short sentence and keeps every comment. It never shows herdr's own wording, which is a JSON envelope around a pane id.

### Agent picker

Each row leads with the agent's name. Its state and tab trail dim behind. The highlight is a
row fill, and everything behind the popup recedes except the footer (`tui.md`).

```
┌ Send 3 comments to ─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1  claude        idle · Grip Outreach · last used           │  ← highlighted, filled row
│ 2  release-bot   idle · Grip Outreach Campaign              │
│ 3  codex         working · 3                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every part comes from herdr:

| part  | herdr source                                                            |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name  | the agent's `name`, else its `display_agent`, else its kind             |
| state | the agent's `state_labels` entry for its state, else the state itself   |
| tab   | the tab's label                                                         |

Two agents in one tab read alike until `herdr agent rename` names one.

The highlight opens on the first of these that is still a candidate:

1. the agent this session sent to last,
2. the agent the sidebar was opened beside,
3. the first row.

Only a successful send sets the first level. The last-sent row carries a dim `last used` tag,
so the remembered default reads before `enter` fires it.

- Rows keep herdr's own order for the workspace. reviewr sorts nothing.
- Only the first nine rows carry a number.
- The row set and its order freeze when the picker opens. A refresh behind it never adds, drops, or reorders a row.
- The picker is a mid-gesture hold, so a refresh behind it never moves the reviewer's place (`overview.md`).

The send addresses the pane on the chosen row. A pane that closed while the picker was open fails the send, and every comment stays. A successful send focuses the chosen agent and names it.

A configuration error closes the picker and drops its frozen rows, which would be stale by the time recovery lands. Every comment survives, and so does the last-sent agent that arms the next picker (`config.md`).

## Clipboard

The export copies through the OS clipboard utility on the machine where the binary runs.

## Turn tracking

The `last-turn` scope (`review-model.md`) needs to know when a turn starts. reviewr polls the agent's status on every worktree refresh. A turn starts when the status moves from resting (`idle` or `done`) to `working`. Moves from `blocked` or `unknown` to `working` do not start a turn.

On a turn start, reviewr snapshots the worktree as a candidate baseline. The candidate becomes the live baseline on the first poll where that turn changed a file. A turn that changes nothing never moves the baseline. The live baseline is the old side of every `last-turn` diff until the next change-producing turn replaces it.

The snapshot never touches the index, the worktree, or any branch. It respects `.gitignore`, so `last-turn` never shows ignored paths. The baseline lives in a private ref under `refs/reviewr/turn-base/`, keyed by worktree path and outside `refs/heads`, so it never appears in a branch list. The ref persists, so reopening the sidebar resumes the same baseline.

## Failure semantics

Actions:

- Two concurrent opens can both open a pane. The next action heals it: `open` no-ops and `close` sweeps both.
- Actions act on the state they observe. A `close` racing an in-flight open exits 0, and the open still lands.
- A crash after the pane opens loses nothing. The label survives, so the next action finds the pane.
- A scripted `open` lands in the focused workspace. A user who switches focus first redirects it. herdr offers no workspace selector on invoke.
- Any pane labeled `reviewr` counts as the sidebar and is swept by the next close.
- An open never opens into the pane that invoked it. A layout pane whose command is the invoke exits when the invoke finishes.
- After a close, focus falls wherever herdr leaves it.

Send and tracking:

- Browsing and the clipboard export work without the herdr CLI. Sending and turn tracking need it. Without it, `last-turn` stays empty and `uncommitted` and `branch` are unaffected.
- Turn tracking uses the same candidates, and additionally prefers a sole agent in the sidebar's own tab over the workspace pool. A plugin sidebar or shell in the tab never pauses tracking.
- A failed clipboard utility or `herdr pane send-text` reports the error. The comments stay in the list.
- A turn shorter than one poll interval, or one whose start is masked by a transient `unknown` status, is missed. `last-turn` then shows the changes since the last observed turn start. It never shows lines the agent did not write.
- A crash mid-snapshot costs at most one failed refresh. Ref updates are atomic. Leftover locks are cleared before the next snapshot and on every exit path.
- Two sidebars on one worktree write the same baseline ref. Each samples on its own clock, so their snapshots of one turn start can differ by the edits between them. Last-writer-wins keeps the baseline within one poll interval of the turn start.

## Non-goals

- No clipboard over SSH. The export targets the local machine.
- No herdr socket subscription. Turn tracking polls.
- No embedding in a caller's pane. The sidebar is always the plugin's own pane.
